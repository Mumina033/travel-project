            <h2>Why Kenya?</h2>
            <h3>
              Kenya offers a unique and immersive journey into the heart of
              Africa
            </h3>
            <p>
              Kenya's allure lies in its diverse landscapes that range from the
              iconic savannahs of the Maasai Mara to the snow-capped peaks of
              Mount Kenya and the pristine beaches of the Kenyan coast.
              Travelers can embark on thrilling safari adventures, witnessing
              the majesty of the Big Five (lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard, and
              rhinoceros) roaming freely in their natural habitats. The
              country's national parks and reserves, such as Amboseli, Tsavo,
              and Samburu, offer unparalleled opportunities for wildlife
              encounters, where visitors can witness the annual wildebeest
              migration in the Maasai Mara or track endangered species like the
              black rhino.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond its natural wonders, Kenya's cultural tapestry is equally
              captivating, with over 40 different ethnic groups each
              contributing to the country's vibrant heritage. From the colorful
              beadwork of the Maasai people to the rhythmic dances of the
              Samburu and the Swahili architecture along the coast, visitors can
              immerse themselves in a rich tapestry of traditions and customs.
              Engaging with local communities through homestays, village visits,
              and cultural performances provides invaluable insights into
              Kenya's diverse society, fostering meaningful connections and
              unforgettable experiences for travelers.
